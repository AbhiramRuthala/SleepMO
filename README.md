# SleepMO
A productivity tool that helps you maximize your potential every morning.

Utilizing the melatonin levels every night, SleepMO provides recommendations on increasing/regulating your melatonin levels so that you can get sound sleep and wake up feeling energized and ready.

For now, SleepMO takes the relative pre-set melatonin values. My goal is to get it to work with my own values based on my behavior and my EEG values.
