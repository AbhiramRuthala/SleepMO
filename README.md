# Incomplete Project: SleepMO
A productivity tool that helps you maximize your potential every morning.

Utilizing the melatonin levels every night, SleepMO provides recommendations on increasing/regulating your melatonin levels so that you can get sound sleep and wake up feeling energized and ready.

# Future Goals
My goal is to get it to work with my own values based on my behavior and my EEG values. I'm currently working on frequency tagging the data using SSVEP and computing comparisons between PSD (Power Spectral Density) and Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR) so that I can practically predict values based on certain sleep factors to be inputted to provide accurate recommendations.

My goal is to also get a fundamental understanding of proper scalp and 3D brain plots. The next step would be to provide these plots within the reports for people to get an insight on their brain's functioning.
